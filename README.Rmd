The goal of Positive Rate Proportion Dashboard is to estimate of the distribution of COVID-19 test positivity rates in communities.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexanderjwhite/covid_proportion_estimation")
```

## Access App

There are two ways to access the app:

* [https://alexanderjwhite.shinyapps.io/positiveproportion/](https://alexanderjwhite.shinyapps.io/positiveproportion/)
* from the package (see below)

```{r eval=FALSE}
run_app()
```

## Instructions

Welcome to the positive rate proportion dashboard. As an example of how the dashboard works, COVID-19 testing data collected by the city of Chicago has been pre-loaded. Follow the steps below to estimate the true positive rate proportion.

1. Format your data as shown in the image below. The first row should contain the column names. Each row in the column named 'tests' should contain the number of tests performed. Each row in the column named 'cases' should contain the number of positive test results. Acceptable formats include .csv, .xlsx, and .xls.

2. Navigate to the Upload tab.

3. Select Browse and upload your file.

4. A table of default positive rate proportion will populate in the Results table. Estimate the positive rate proportion for a custom range by adjusting the sliding bar and selecting Update.

## Background

The distribution of COVID-19 test positivity rate in communities (e.g. proportion of communities with test positivity rate below certain threshold) is critically important to guide public health and policy responses. If 10 out of 50 zip code areas in a city have a test positivity rate below 5% then the na誰ve estimate of the proportion is $\frac{10}{50}=0.2$. The na誰ve estimate, however, ignores the margin of error of the test positivity rate in each zip code, which could lead to either over- or under-estimate of the proportion. This online application uses a statistical method called Bayesian deconvolution to generate a more accurate estimate.

### Figure 1

Illustration on how the native calculation can result in overly-optimistic or overly-pessimistic estimate of the proportion of community-level test positivity rate below a threshold.

### Legend

The figure on the left side shows one scenario where the na誰ve estimate will overestimate the proportion of community level test positivity rate of 5% or less as compared with estimate that accounts for the margin of errors (adjusted estimate). The red area indicates the magnitude of over-optimism. The figure on the right side shows one scenario where the na誰ve estimate will overestimate the proportion of community level test positivity rate of 5% or more. The red area indicates the magnitude of over-pessimism.
